= SubGrabber

Get a subtitle for a video by searching on OpenSubtitles.org.

This program started as a toy project to learn https://www.rust-lang.org[Rust]
so the code might not be idiomatic and can be improved.
However if the OpenSubtitles API is up then it should work as expected.

You are welcome to submit pull requests for any suggestion or improvement.

== Getting started

=== Installation

Make sure you have https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/[cargo] installed.

. Download a copy of this repo.
. Run `cargo install`, subgrabber should now be installed in `~/.cargo/bin/`.

=== Usage

Given a video `downloads/my_movie.mp4`:
 subgrabber downloads/my_movie.mp4

The subtitle will be downloaded to `downloads/my_movie.srt`.

== Notes

* Currently SubGrabber uses a generic user agent for the API calls.
* Only tested on linux, should work on macOS, might not work on Windows.
